Needed modes:
normal - take raw input, maps it, and outputs it
sync1 - motor 2 = motor 1
sync2 - motor 1 = motor 2
syncReverse1 - motor 2 = reverse of motor 1
syncReverse2 - motor 1 = reverse of motor 2
sweep - takes raw input and uses it as a time for a full period
sweepSync1 - sweeps both according to pot 1
sweepSync2 - sweeps both according to pot 2
sweepSyncReverse1 - sweeps both according to pot1 but reverses 2
sweepSyncReverse2 - sweeps both according to pot2 but reverses 1

----------------------
SPTT switch - sync off, 1>2, 2>1
Make separate sync switch that either syncs 2 to 1 or 1 to 2
----------------------
SPDT - reverse off, reverse on
Make separate reverse switch that makes the synced output go opposite, ignored without sync selected
----------------------
SPDT - Function switch
normal
sweep
